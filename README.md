# 🧠 TypeScript + React Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of small, focused projects built with **React + TypeScript** to help reinforce TypeScript fundamentals while applying them in real-world UI components.

Each project targets specific TypeScript and React concepts for progressive learning.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Strengthen understanding of TypeScript syntax, generics, interfaces, and utility types
- ✅ Learn how to apply types to React props, state, and event handlers
- ✅ Practice API fetching and typing remote data
- ✅ Build useful UI components with type safety and scalability in mind
- ✅ Use real-world patterns like form handling, localStorage, and reusable hooks

---

## 📚 Concepts to Be Applied

### 🟦 TypeScript
- `interface` and `type` definitions
- Generics (e.g., `useState<T>()`, custom hooks)
- Type inference and annotations
- Event types (`React.ChangeEvent`, `MouseEvent`, etc.)
- Enums and Union types
- Utility types: `Partial`, `Record`, `Pick`, etc.
- Optional and readonly properties
- Typing API responses

### ⚛️ React
- Functional components with typed props
- State management with `useState` and `useReducer`
- Side effects with `useEffect`
- Controlled components for form handling
- Component composition and props drilling
- Conditional rendering
- Custom hooks with generics
- Working with localStorage and side effects

## 🔧 Tools You Can Use

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – for fast React + TS setup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – for utility-first styling (optional)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) – for typed API requests
- React Developer Tools – for debugging component behavior
